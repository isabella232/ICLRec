# Intent Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation (ICLRec)

Source code for paper: [Intent Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.02519.pdf)

## Introduction

Motivation: 

Users' interactions with items are driven by various underlying intents. These intents are potentially beneficial to learn a better users' preferences toward massive item set.

## Implementation
### Requirements

Python >= 3.7  
Pytorch >= 1.2.0  
tqdm == 4.26.0

### Datasets

Four prepared datasets are included in `data` folder.

### Train Model

To train ICLRec on `Sports_and_Outdoors` dataset, change to the `src` folder and run following command: 

```
python main.py --data_name Sports_and_Outdoors
```

The script will automatically train ICLRec and save the best model found in validation set, and then evaluate on test set.


### Evaluate Model

You can directly evaluate a trained model on test set by running:

```
python main.py --data_name Sports_and_Outdoors --model_idx 0 --do_eval
```

We provide a model that trained on Sports_and_Games dataset in `./src/output` folder. Please feel free to test is out.

## Acknowledgment
 - Transformer and training pipeline are implemented based on [S3-Rec](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/CIKM2020-S3Rec). Thanks them for providing efficient implementation.
